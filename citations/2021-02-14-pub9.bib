abstract = "Museum exhibitions on traditional Chinese paintings are gaining popularity for educational and cultural value. Chinese paintings are characterized by a long history and implicit emotional expression, and it is challenging for non-professional and non-Chinese visitors to understand. To enhance museum visitors’ interest and comprehension of Chinese artworks, we design an EEG-based interactive installation. The installation simulates the process of creation of a work of art, in this case a painting. Visitors can control the generation of lines, colors, and movements of characters by wearing a commercial EEG headset. Our interactive design contributes a novel experience of ’painting with your mind’ and at the same time transform the exhibition into an enjoyable game experience.",
