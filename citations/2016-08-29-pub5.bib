abstract = "This study focuses on gender differences in the influence of online communication on e-commerce purchase decision strategies. From the literature, we deduce a new theoretical model based on three foundational theories and design a 2 ∗ 2 mixed factorial experiment to test the influence of online communication in cases with and without online communication. This involves analyzing screen-recording data to check the effect of shopping behavior initiation, and using questionnaire research to test differences in the user experience before and after such communication. Finally, we concluded that the influence of online communication differs between men and women, and the influence is largely positive to both males and females."
